      The fire is what distinguished it. The grass – which unlike green grass, which grew much like a vibrant, well-watered spring grass in front of the white picket fence of the iconic American home – had the color of an emerald that had been drained of its color. Against the muted forest hues, the leaves burned in stark contrast with the bare trees surrounding them. Despite the iconic sharp yet palatable shades typical of fall, the triadic tones were fading to tenable nonexistence with winter’s sharp inhale. The weak-looking tree snaked up to the heavens, reaching slightly higher than the surrounding plant life, nearly colorless at this point. At a quick glance from a distance, the leaves enveloping the tree appeared to be a drizzle of color over a dull canvas.

      Surprisingly, the tree’s visage stood nearly intact despite the lack of salience in the colors of the environment surrounding it. It is conceivable that the sharp juxtaposition made the tree out to be more significant than it would have been in a different time or place. If the tree were nonexistent, the extreme ends of the color concentrated in the setting would be redefined, and an observer would likely note a wider range of color after being forced to examine a small subsection of the overall vast spectrum. If the observer were to know nothing more; surely they would make slight differentiations. Amongst a forest of trees with foliage a uniform enthusiastic orange-red, this tree was standard. In a consistently unusual environment, most everything is common in its dissimilarity. Perhaps it was not the fire that distinguished it; after all, the stars only appear bright because of the immense blackness surrounding them.
