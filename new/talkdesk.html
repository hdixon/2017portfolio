          Before I was given the official assignment brief, I knew very little other than the project was concerned abstractly with the idea of thresholds, and alerts/notifications. A design brief appeared in my inbox:
      </p>

      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure pl4 bl bw1 b--gold mb3">
          We want to provide insights to our supervisors so that they can monitor everything from call volume to agent status. A performance threshold usually represents a target zone of performance. For example, a supervisor may set a target zone for <i>average wait time</i>.
          This is the amout of time (on average) that a caller will wait on the phone before their call is routed. Lets say, the supervisor wants an alert any time the average wait time exceeds ten minutes. This is a simple binary threshold: below
          10 minutes is “good," above is “bad."
      </p>

      <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure">
          So far, so good. A simple binary alert. But in the real world, sometimes this simple system is too rigid, neglecting to inform the user of relevant information. The crux of this design challenge seems related to this idea of "thresholds."
      </p>

      <p class="f6 lh-copy measure pl4 bl bw1 b--gold mb3">
          Now lets add more value for the supervisor by adding a third “caution” zone to represent when the metric is approaching “bad” but not quite there yet. We want to figure out the easiest way for supervisors to
          <emph class="fw6 i">customize</emph> these thresholds.
      </p>

      <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure">
          Thoughtful representation and painless customization. Now we have a target.

      Where to begin?

    <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure">
        In situations like these, I usually start by asking several questions to help add some form to this abstract idea.

      Why is this feature important?

      Why does this solve a need?
    </p>
    <ol class="lh-title mt0 measure">
      <li class="pv2 fw4">A system for setting thresholds is neccessary yet currently absent from TalkDesk’s product.</li>
      <li class="pv2 fw4">The threshold system needs to be easy for admins to adapt goals to existing team’s performance.</li>
      <li class="pv2 fw4">Not every admin is an expert, so we should provide contextual recommendations and opportunities to more deeply understand the system.</li>
      <li class="pv2 fw4">Nobody is keeping vigilant 24/7 watch over their dashboard; warnings need to be clear and accompanied with possible solutions.</li>

      How do other designers solve this problem?
    </p>
    <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure">
      Seeing the way others approached the problem usually leads to a wide variety of solutions, especially if the problem is less prolific. In my research on thresholds and warnings, it quickly became clear the diversity of ways designers approached the same problem. I’ll include some ways of addressing the threshold problem below, sorted by which company is responsible for the design pattern.

        Apple’s Activity Monitor is designed to display a lot of data to the user, and its UI is a good example of information hierarchy. Your eyes are drawn to the important, high-level representations of data.
