                Before I was given the official assignment brief, I knew very little
                other than the project was concerned abstractly with the idea of
                thresholds, and alerts/notifications. Without warning, a design
                brief appeared in my inbox:</p>
            <p class="f6 lh-copy measure i pl4 bl bw1 b--gold mb3">
                We want to provide insights to our supervisors so that they can monitor
                everything from call volume to agent status. A performance threshold
                usually represents a target zone of performance. For example, a
                supervisor may set a target zone for <i>average wait time</i>.
                This is the amout of time (on average) that a caller will wait on
                the phone before their call is routed. Lets say, the supervisor wants an alert
                any time the average wait time exceeds ten minutes. This is a simple
                binary threshold: below 10 minutes is “good," above is “bad."
              </p>
              <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
                So far, so good. A simple binary alert. But in the real world,
                sometimes this simple system is too rigid, neglecting to inform
                the user of relevant information. The crux of this design challenge
                has to do with the word "thresholds"
              </p>

                <!-- Now lets add more value for the supervisor by adding a third “caution” zone to represent when the metric is approaching “bad” but not quite there yet. For this UI challenge, we want to figure out the easiest way
                for supervisors to customize these thresholds. Don’t forget to ask questions as there may be unforeseen requirements. One such challenge would be the direction of the threshold. For Avg Wait Time anything above 10m is bad. But for another
                metric like Avg Abandonment Time (the average time in which a caller will hangup before the call is answered), anything below 5m might be good. -->

            <h6 class="">Where to start?</h5>
            <p class="f6 f5-ns lh-copy measure georgia">
              To further understand such a design problem, I usually start by asking several questions to help add some form to this abstract idea.
