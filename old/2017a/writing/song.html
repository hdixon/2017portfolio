      his pants overcompensate for the stressed sweater<br>
      as much as his sweater choke his chest<br>
      the pants sag droop wilt<br>
      stemming from below the waist<br>
      leaving room for a blotch of exposed skin<br>
      in limbo between the encroaching upper and deficient lower halves<br>
      the partitions inwardly screaming at one another to connect<br>
      outwardly existing in stark uncooperation<br>

      a small boy tugs at my hand<br>
      the boy's hand uneasily rough against my skin<br>
      weathered by undeserved experience<br>
      his dark eyes cast upwards towards me in expectance<br>
      perhaps in curiosity<br>
      (a marked trait)<br>
      dressed well and poorly<br>
      his sweater struggles to subdue his overstuffed stomach<br>
      stretching not-quite-enough to reach his equator<br>
      the blues and reds of the sweater drained of their vibrancy<br>
      colors muted and muffled through years of thorough wear<br>
      in passive contrast with the fiercely definite primary colors dripped on the walls<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      the small dark hand was a coarse shadow gnawing at mine<br>
      those hands had accomplished things they should not have<br>
      they completed tasks i would never approach<br>
      a certain wisdom of experience existed in these hands<br>
      but the sensation did not extend to his face<br>
      momentarily engulfed in childlike questioning<br>

    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      "am  i going to be okay?" he asks<br>
      i could not answer him<br>

      the city frowns as rain leaks down the window<br>
      i found the rain sad<br>
      i do not know why<br>
      it simply was<br>

      as my father steered the sedan forward the muddle populated alleyways and narrow streets crawled past our view<br>
      my father's expression was controlled<br>
      yet concern leaked from the crevices in his visage<br>
      we slowed as the headlights focused on a building in the distance<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      the minute building stood in two divisions<br>
      nevertheless small for a single family<br>

    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      the structure was linear<br>
      a mathematically perfected object<br>
      subsequently warped by weather until it faded into the dreariness of its backdrop<br>
      the edifice lacked the required disposition<br>
      just adjacent lay a stenciled sign faded just as the surroundings<br>
      the signpost no longer rooted in the patch of non-asphalt<br>
      read medford housing authority<br>
      tasted particularly synthetic<br>
      the house<br>
      not the home<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      the chipped paint appeared bothersome to the rain<br>
      nature had effected its own aesthetic upon the walls<br>
      the faded grey seemed to fit the current atmosphere<br>
      although i am unsure this was the intention of the painter<br>

      the 'basketball court' tolerated the environment much like a kitten does a bathtub<br>
      its singular off-center hoop lacked netting and a complete backboard<br>
      clearly incapable of welcoming an organized game of any kind<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      the black tar subsisted in complacent resistance<br>
      amongst the collection of misfit objects strained together to form the environment<br>
      unlike the chaos round the pavement<br>
      it sat comfortably<br>
      which unnerved me so<br>
      how did it discover contentment in such a place<br>

    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      my father never embodied emotional clarity<br>
      but now his affect was particularly blurred<br>
      not exactly longing<br>
      not exactly content<br>

      it can be therapeutic to reflect upon accomplishments<br>
      but i would not celebrate that which i do not find good<br>
      for everything can be improved upon and is thusly not good<br>
      all can be completed and bettered<br>
      circumscribed to the orbit of acceptability<br>

      to this point has been tripping forward and flailing into blackness<br>
      the endless vacuum of nothing<br>
      the forest is darkly foreboding in the struggle to find the exit easily<br>
      without a light, the i advance unknowingly without a path<br>
      for what is in darkness is not unknown<br>
      it is simply nothing<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      i am as an explorer born visionless<br>
      blind yet i do not see blackness<br>
      (for blackness is a sight)<br>
      i simply see nothing<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      i have been told that i must "find a path" and "make my way"<br>
      if not for me, for those coming after me<br>
      for i am told my brothers depend upon it<br>
      they depend upon my finding a path<br>
      so that they may find theirs<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      i am told to consider others when making a decision concerning solely myself<br>
      i however make not the path<br>

      we do not consist of thoughts and cognizance<br>

      the variance enticed me to the forest<br>
      both the difference inside and the dissimilarity outside<br>
      sufficient space<br>
      while not vast and feral<br>
      familiar and worn by me in my passings<br>
      an intrinsic paradox within the natural and the artificial<br>
      maintainting a balance of imbalance<br>

    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      the forest asks nothing of me<br>

      perched on the edge of a log i survey the lake which lies a distance from me<br>
      the morning calm apparent at first glance<br>
      lacking sound<br>
      adding to the paradoxically supernatural essence<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      in the foreground stands a tree<br>
      an authoritative oak reaching over the pristine but enigmatic lake<br>
      maintaining intensely embedded in the ground without a question of stability<br>

    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      a frayed rope straightens down to the water's surface<br>
      as if it were a fisherman deploying his lobsterpots<br>
      the manufactured rope does not appear as thus<br>
      as if remaining as an extension to the tree<br>

      accepting the forest not fighting it<br>
      a boy grasps a branch tightly in his left hand<br>
      his right guiding his balance<br>
      (ensuring his separation from the lake)<br>
      he slowly deliberately contrives intimacy between his hand and the rope<br>
      drops the branch as he clenches the rope firmly between his palms and fingers<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      naturally he wears no shirt<br>
      as he snakes towards me still with rope<br>
      various muscle groups contract with his movement<br>
      creates a continuous ripple<br>
      a wave<br>
      washes down his body with frequency yet ease<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      pausing<br>
      drinks in the entirety of the scene<br>
      allows it to splash over him without resistance before he tenses and hugs the rope allowing gravity and natural law to overtake his human compulsions <br>
      as time seems to slow<br>
      his body is at rest in the air<br>
      floating several feet above the surface<br>
      while even the foliage surrounding halts movement<br>
      as a show of respect to its kin<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      no longer is the rope contained in his hands<br>
      it begins to swing free as he allows it<br>
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      drops into liquid tranquility<br>
      swallows him as the forest has<br>

      when a friend unknowingly ushered his car into ultimately utter disfigurement<br>
      the car's plain interior dripping of alcohol-saturated blood<br>
      the blood of the 'young and promising'<br>

    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure-wide">
      when his mother was left alone in the world after his father faded from knowledgeable existence<br>
      when the happy helpful harmless and holy woman was left broken<br>
      when her perpetual smile buckled into a frown and tears<br>
      	(an expression of visceral vehement perturbation)<br>
      death seemed unnatural to me<br>

      those at the funeral<br>
      those sobbing wailing screeching<br>
      engulfed in masses of people sharing<br>
      in the experience<br>
      perhaps frightened me more than the departure of a human being<br>
      the being which had effected a joy in these people<br>
      the being which no one would experience physically for an eternity<br>
