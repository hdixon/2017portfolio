      I was on one of those buses that takes you into the city. Public transportation.
      When I'd entered the bus, I noticed that all of the seats on the bus were
      full, but there were few people standing. There was not a feeling of the
      bus being overcrowded; it seemed to me as though everything was in its place.
      So I stopped at the front of the bus and grabbed onto one of the metal poles
      which were installed in and above the aisles so that people who couldn't find
      room to sit would be less likely to find themselves on the ground if the bus
      came to a sudden stop. I was standing behind the driver, right across the
      aisle as though I was serving as his first mate, or a conductor on his train.
      Ready to assist the captain if he needed it, but flanking him behind and to
      the right as any sidekick would, he was in direct line of sight so that I
      could see and hear the entirety of his brief interactions with all of my
      fellow bus-riders, which was a major part of the reason why I liked my
      standing arrangement. I loved witnessing the lines of people exiting the
      bus, each saying thank you as they passed the driver. I always noticed
      the few deviants who would exit the bus silently, often either glaring
      or absorbed in their headphones, and sometimes both. There were those who
      took the extra energy to smile, and add something like "and I hope you have
      a good day!" For the duration of the ride, I never heard him go beyond
      using two words, which he sometimes accompanied with a gesture when the
      words didn't convey enough information.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      We stop, and the driver presses the button that tilts the whole bus to the
      side with loud, hissing hydraulic pumps, as if the bus is a turtle trying
      to let a small animal ride on its shell. A round black man with a cane,
      wearing a worn <i>American Veteran</i> baseball hat climbed onto the bus,
      grasping at the hand-railing as support. It surprised me that he was so big for
      how old he was, even though he didn't seem to be particularly old.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      The round old man had entered the bus by now, and I watched him look up at
      the horizon of the bus, searching through the crowd of people in an attempt
      to find a seat to sit in. Before he finished this process, a college student
      wearing a blue backpack whose straps were configured just slightly too loose
      bolted straight up, knees locked and back erect, as though to distinctly
      convey that he was intending to stand and clear up any confusion. The man
      with the cane locked his eyes with those of the student and said, "Sit down."
      The way he said it -- so loudly and clearly -- it came off as abrupt, and the
      student quickly sat down, having made his offer to have it promptly rejected.
      The man with the cane quickly said, less gruffly this time "but thank you,
      I appreciate it," as though something in the atmosphere was no longer as
      balanced as it was before.
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      As the recorded voice which was omnipresent in the bus announced the
      name of the stop, I took a step forward, thanked my captain, and wished
      him well. As the doors opened, I heard a tired voice call "you too."
