      “I’m a hypocrite. I don’t consume my own product. I don’t watch TV that
      has commercials... I hate pre-roll. I go to another screen, count to 15
      and then come back. I hate it. I don’t want to look at it.” The way Collin
      Sheehan sees it, advertising has come a long way since the time of
      “booze and cigarettes” and everything else from the Mad-Men era.
      According to Collin, the one thing that will remain the same is telling
      visual stories. If you can tell an effective story—if you can make people
      feel something in a TV-ad—you’re already on your way to producing pre-roll,
      online video, and Vines. As advertising continues to evolve, so does the
      way students prepare for a career in it. Collin explained, “I think I’m
      the last guy to get a job without going to a portfolio center or something
      like that,” and there’s good and bad that comes with it. “I think there’s
      probably a lot of really great minds out there that might not go to a
      portfolio school,” yet he thinks that the advertisements that generally
      come from a portfolio school are good. At the same time, he pointed out,
      “there’s a pattern to [these ads]... it’s a race to simplicity and
      minimizing branding... and who knows what the next best thing is going to be?”
      At the same time, Collin says that “it definitely accelerates you about four
      or five years in the business... and it’s a great pattern.”
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      In the age of Ad-Blockers, the power is with the consumers to decide
      whether to consume it, and “typically you’re only going to consume it if
      there’s some kind of entertainment value to you... it’s on [the advertisers]
      to be more interesting.” As new technologies continue to emerge, more media
      becomes available. As a consumer, Collin embraces the change by switching
      the channel when he hears a TV spot and running to the bathroom during
      pre-roll on YouTube. Like most modern audiences, he scours the web for
      good content. “I’ll go on reddit and if someone has a funny enough ad, or
      if someone makes something funny, or if it’s forwarded to me — that’s how
      I consume it.”
    </p>
    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Collin acknowledges that a lot has happened to the world during his last
      ten years in advertising. “I didn’t get an email [address] until I got out
      of college... but anyone born after that had an email in elementary school.
      Now kids have iPads.” During our conversation, began to express his fear
      that our world will become one where nobody ever looks up from a screen—but
      he stopped himself. “We’re already there. People don’t walk down the
      street the same way... even people who live in New York suck at walking
      in New York because their face is planted into a screen, where before
      they walked with purpose.” Collin agrees that advertising is driving that,
      because “advertising is what pays for a lot of that content that people are consuming...
      The blood is on our hands.”

    <p class="f5 lh-copy measure">
      Some media is bad, some media is good, and a very small portion of media
      is truly excellent. Advertising is no different. Filmmakers scoff at
      Hollywood flops, writers avoid predictable stories, and advertisers
      visit the bathroom when a second-rate commercials interrupts their TV show.
      People who create media do it to create something that moves people, and
      Collin is no different. “I grew up watching commercials that gave me
      goosebumps. I respond emotionally to stuff like that, whether it be a piece
      of music, or TV, or a movie... or you know, a commercial.”
